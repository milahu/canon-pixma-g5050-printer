# How to remove air from ink tubes in a Canon Pixma G5050 tank printer

Air in the ink tubes should be removed as soon as possible, ideally on the same day it got there. Here we do not talk about small air bubbles, which are normal, but rather completely empty ink tubes.

Two problems:

1. The remaining ink in the tubes will dry and clog the tubes.
2. The print cartridges have no more ink supply, and if you continue to print, the cartridges will dry out.

## Simple Solution

Printer menu > Maintenance > Ink flush

While the ink flush is running, you can open the printer cover, and watch the ink tubes being filled with ink. When all tubes are filled, simply cut the printer's power supply to stop the ink flush, to avoid wasting too much ink.

## Warning

This instruction comes without any warranty. If you break your printer, its your problem.

## Risks

Potential risks include:

When rotating the printer more than 90 degrees (with the ink valve open), ink can leak out of the tank (via the air-pulling-tubes) and drop on the sensor strip (that measures the printhead position). This can be avoided by covering the parts below the ink tanks with soft paper.

### Syringes

If you have a small syringe at hand (for example 5 ml syringe with 4 mm "luer slip" connector), you can avoid rotating the printer alltogether.

Instead of letting gravitiy pull the ink, you can close 3/4 ink terminals with ballpen leads, and connect the syringe to the remaining ink terminal. The syringe connector may be too large for the ink terminals. Do not force the syringe into the terminals, rather just push it on them. The terminals are made of silicone, so the connection will be air-tight.

Now open the ink valve and pull the syringe, until the ink tube is completely filled with ink (no more air). Close the ink valve and repeat for the other ink terminals.

### Tubes

If you want to prepare for this repair: Get some silicone tubes with different diameters: 4 millimeter outer diameter (2x4 mm) for the black ink terminal, 3 millimeter outer diameter (1x3 mm) for the color ink terminals. Then you can push the silicon tubes into the ink terminals and connect your syringe to the silicon tube.

The 1x3 mm tube will be a challenge to connect, cos the "luer slip" medical syringes have 4-4.5 mm connectors. Probably you need a 3x5 mm tube as adapter. The 3x5 mm tube is also useful to refill the ink bottles with cheap ink.

## Step 1

We will let ink flow from the tanks to the print cartridge terminal. Every color will flow at a different speed, and some tubes will be filled with ink earlier than other tubes. To avoid spilling ink around the ink terminal, as soon as one color has arrived and starts flowing outside, we block the ink terminal. The three color terminals need cylinders of about 2 millimeter in diameter, the one black color terminal needs a cylinder of about 3 millimeter in diameter. Ball-pen leads can be used here.

## Step 2

Close the ink valve with the light-gray handle over the ink tubes. The close position is marked by a 'repair tools' symbol, the open position is marked by a 'print' symbol.

## Step 3

Move the print heads to the center - this should go easy, be gentle. Also do not pull on the ink tubes.

## Step 4

Open the cartridge holder by pulling the cover upwards.

## Step 5

Rotate the printer on its back, to make it stand on the back side, where the cables are/were connected. Now the ink tanks are above the ink terminals, and gravity can pull ink down to the terminals.

## Step 6

Open the ink valve again. Now ink should start flowing towards the ink terminals. If not, rotate the printer further, so the ink terminals move to the bottom, and gravity can pull ink from the tanks. As soon as ink is flowing, rotate the printer back to make it stand on its back side.

## Step 7

Monitor the ink terminals. Bubbles can be ignored, but as soon as one color starts coming as liquid, close the ink valve, and block the one color terminal. Then open the ink valve again, and repeat until all ink terminals are supplied with ink, and all ink tubes are completely filled with ink.

## Step 8

With the ink valve closed, remove the blocking cylinders from the ink terminals. Clean the ink terminals with soft paper, to remove excess ink from the terminals.

## Step 9

Rotate the printer back to its normal position. Close the cartridge holder. Open the ink valve. Done!

## Step 10

To avoid the problem of 'air in ink tubes' in the future, close the ink valve before you open the cartridge holder, or before you must rotate the printer, like for transport.
